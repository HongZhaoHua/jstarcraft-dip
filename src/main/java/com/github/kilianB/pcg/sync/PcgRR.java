/**
 * A 64 bit State PcgRNG with 32 bit output. PCG-XSH-RR <p>
 * 
 * The pcg family combines a linear congruential generators with a permutation
 * output function resulting in high quality pseudo random numbers. <p>
 * 
 * The original concept was introduced by Melissa O’Neill please refer to <a
 * href="http://www.pcg-random.org/">pcg-random</a> for more information. <p>
 * 
 * The RR instance permutates the output using the following function:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * int shift = (int) (((state >>> 18) ^ state) >>> 27);
 * int rotation = (int) (state >>> 59);
 * return Integer.rotateRight(shift, rotation);
 *}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Regarding the RR Instance:
 * 
 * "[...The] design goal is to be a good all-purpose random number generator.
 * The intent is to balance speed with statistical performance and reasonable
 * security, charting a middle-of-the-road path. (It’s the generator that I
 * recommend for most users.) The strategy is to perform an xorshift to improve
 * the high bits, then randomly rotate them so that all bits are full period.
 * Hence the mnemonic PCG-XSH-RR, “xorshift high (bits), random rotation”."
 * 
 * This implementation is thread safe utilizing method level synchronization.
